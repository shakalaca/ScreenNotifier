There's no status indicator in Samsung Galaxy S (i9000), so I borrow 
madmack@xda's idea and create this little application.

Reference: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=730692

Install and 
1. reboot to use it, or 
2. press power key and press home key, de-activate the lock.

A red dot will be on screen if there're missed phone call or sms.

Just for fun, any questions feel free contact me :-)
